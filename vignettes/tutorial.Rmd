# Introduction

# The Data

We are using a subset of the 1000 Genomes data, on about 10,000
positions, along with some sample annotations with invented
phenotypes, as provided by the Hail tutorial
(https://hail.is/docs/stable/tutorials/hail-overview.html).

# Setup

The hailr package will automatically ensure that Hail is installed and
configured for this demonstration. To use a system installation of
Hail, outside of this example, see `?use_hail_home`.
